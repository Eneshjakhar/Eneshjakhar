### 🚀 What I’m Building

- **TA Connect** – A role-based web app that streamlines TA requests, manual allocations, and feedback for UBCO’s CMPS department (React · Node.js · PostgreSQL).

- **HelpMe AI (Directed Studies)** – Contributing to Dr. Ramon Lawrence’s near-launch HelpMe project: polishing React features, hardening the backend API, and providing technical support during rollout.

- **FitFusion** – A fitness-tech concept that blends AI-driven workout plans, meal suggestions, and real-time tracking. Integrates with Apple Health, curates playlists to match exercise intensity, and aims for ad-free monetization via tiered memberships.
